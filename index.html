				<div class = "entry"><p> I was at school, and I was talking to some kid who was in the car, and we were in the car, and we were talking and laughing and joking around. And she was going to be there for a little while, and it was like, "Wait a minute, what do you do?" And that's how I woke up. </p></div>

				<div class = "entry"><p> Trying to hunt down some old books. Though I knew it was a library, I couldn't remember how to get them. I think I found some of the first century bookcases, but I didn't know how to put them on the shelf. I went back to my room and I was all dressed up. My mother wanted me to have a dinner with her. She wasn't sure what to do with me, but I knew what I wanted her to do. I told her I wanted to have a dinner with her, but I didn't want to do that because I didn't want to be late for dinner. I followed her to get my plate. I got to the end of the dining hall and I was almost to the 2nd floor. I was talking to my mother about something about the library. She wasn't sure what, but I said, "It's not my library." She said, "Oh, I don't know. It's almost time for me to go to the library. I can't go to the library." I said, "Okay, but I want to go to the library as well." She said, "Sure, you can go. I didn't know you would want to."</p></div>

				<div class = "entry"><p> I was in a place that was like a store, but it was different. It was a place that had a lot of walls and a lot of rooms. There was a group of people that were trying to kill me. They were trying to kill the teacher and then I woke up. I got to the place and I didn't know what to do. I kept trying to get out of there because it was so complicated, but I didn't know what to do. I don't know if it was suicide or if it was just a dream. Then I woke up. </p></div>

				<div class = "entry"><p> I was at some place where people were being executed. Then I was there. I was trying to get away from the people. This other guy and I made out in the sand. We were in a place where we were going to be executed. We were going to go to this place. I was showing this guy my car and he wanted to get out of it so I left, and I could see him coming back. Then I was at some place that had a movie, and then I was there. I was going to kill myself. I tried to crawl through this hole in the sand. I put my hand on the rock and I fell, but this other guy was in the sand, and I killed him. I was watching the movie with Tom Tork and I was in a car. I was going to kill myself.</p></div>

				<div class = "entry"><p>There was a comet out there, and it was going to be a big one, and it was going to hit us. And we were going to be afraid that we would have to take the power of the comet out of the power of the earth, and then it would be a big one, and it would get bigger, and it would get bigger and bigger, and then it would hit us, and we would get scared. And then we went in and then we were like sitting on the side of the plane, and [laugh] and that was kind of fun. The dream ended there. [laugh]</p></div>
