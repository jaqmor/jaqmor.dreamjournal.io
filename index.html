				<div class = "entry"><p> I am with a group of people. I am in the middle of nowhere in an area that seems to be mountain range. I have been told that we have to cross a bridge. It is a very steep hill. We have to walk on borrowed time. It is dark. I get up and try to cross. I am holding my <a class = "limb">foot</a> in the air. I put my <a class = "limb">hand</a> on the ground and try to hold on. I feel the ground and move my <a class = "limb">foot</a>. I think I can. I am exhausted. I am afraid we will die. I see the bridge. It is steep. I am afraid the people will fall. I try to hold on as I walk. I keep trying to hold on. I struggle. I am afraid of falling and I struggle. Finally I manage to hold on. I don't want to die. </p></div>
				<div class = "entry"><p> I was at school, and I was talking to some kid who was in the <a class = "car">car</a>, and we were in the <a class = "car">car</a>, and we were talking and laughing and joking around. And she was going to be there for a little while, and it was like, "Wait a minute, what do you do?" And that's how I woke up. </p></div>
				<div class = "entry"><p> Trying to hunt down some old books. Though I knew it was a library, I couldn't remember how to get them. I think I found some of the first century bookcases, but I didn't know how to put them on the shelf. I went back to my room and I was all dressed up. My mother wanted me to have a dinner with her. She wasn't sure what to do with me, but I knew what I wanted her to do. I told her I wanted to have a dinner with her, but I didn't want to do that because I didn't want to be late for dinner. I followed her to get my plate. I got to the end of the dining hall and I was almost to the 2nd floor. I was talking to my mother about something about the library. She wasn't sure what, but I said, "It's not my library." She said, "Oh, I don't know. It's almost time for me to go to the library. I can't go to the library." I said, "Okay, but I want to go to the library as well." She said, "Sure, you can go. I didn't know you would want to."</p></div>
				<div class = "entry"><p> I was in a small room; I don't know where it was but I was in a room that had a couch, a bed, a door. I thought it was a room that I would like to have sex with and I had a couple of friends come in. I decided I would have sex with them and I went in and I got some of the things and started to go to bed. I pulled up my shirt and I was trying to have a sexual encounter with them. I don't know what happened but they said no and I was mad at them for not doing something about it. </p></div>
				<div class = "entry"><p>I was a baby in the dream, and I was in the basement of a building. I was hiding, in the basement, in the basement, and I was playing with the little girl. The dream was interrupted by a policeman. He came in and shot me. I was the policeman. I chased him, and he shot me. I was in the basement. My brother was there. We escaped from a policeman. He shot us and got the gun pointed at us. My brother was shot in the arm. The policeman shot him in the arm. He was a good shot. He had a revolver. I shot him twice in the chest and the heart. I shot him. I yelled at him. He shot him again and shot me again. I shot him again and again. He shot me again. I was thinking of how to get out of the basement, to the basement. I was afraid to get out of the basement, because I didn't know where I wanted to go. I was afraid I was going to be caught. I ran. I ran into a building, and the policeman came to me. He looked like a detective. I asked him if he knew me. He pointed to me and said, "Hi.”</p></div>
				<div class = "entry"><p> I was in a place that was like a store, but it was different. It was a place that had a lot of walls and a lot of rooms. There was a group of people that were trying to kill me. They were trying to kill the teacher and then I woke up. I got to the place and I didn't know what to do. I kept trying to get out of there because it was so complicated, but I didn't know what to do. I don't know if it was suicide or if it was just a dream. Then I woke up. </p></div>
				<div class = "entry"><p>I am at a rave. It is a night-time gathering. There are many tables, one or two big and one or two small. I'm fed up with sitting there. I'm frustrated with everyone for being so bad. I am a bit frustrated with myself. I can't seem to keep my cool and I keep getting frustrated because I don't think I can do it well. It's a bit frustrating. But the place I'm at is very pleasant. I feel very comfortable. I feel very <a class = "happy">happy</a>. It is a <a class = "happy">happy</a> place. I see many other people there. I see a couple of women, maybe women, dressed in suits. They are tossing and turning, dancing. They are very <a class = "happy">happy</a>. I feel very <a class = "happy">happy</a>. I see some men and women, maybe men, with very long hair and tattoos. They are each holding a tattoo. I see that they are not only holding them, but they are holding such a nice tattoo that they are trying to hide it. They are trying to hide it so they won't be identified.</p></div>
				<div class = "entry"><p>There was a comet out there, and it was going to be a big one, and it was going to hit us. And we were going to be afraid that we would have to take the power of the comet out of the power of the earth, and then it would be a big one, and it would get bigger, and it would get bigger and bigger, and then it would hit us, and we would get scared. And then we went in and then we were like sitting on the side of the plane, and [laugh] and that was kind of fun. The dream ended there. [laugh]</p></div>

I got down on my <a class = "limb">hands</a> and knees and crawled into the room, breathlessly waiting for the door to slam and leave me trapped inside. I was terrified. I finally got into the room and the door closed behind me. I could feel the walls creaking and the air rushing past back into the room as I struggled inside. I couldn't think of anything to say, but I heard a sound and I didn't want to wake her. I finally managed to get up, and I looked around to see if anyone was in the room. I saw my brother and sister.

I feel a little uncomfortable and uneasy about the penis. We kiss and she has a huge, heavy, hard, hard penis. It is a real hard, long erection. She loves that! I go on ahead and go on ahead. I feel a little uncomfortable. I'm in the middle of my teen or college years. I'm in a group of people, mostly older women. They are on the couch, on a couch, in a bed. I am trying to get comfortable with them. I say, "Will you go into the bathroom and flush the toilet?" They say, "No." Then, what we do is we lean forward in our seat, and we just keep peeing into a toilet as you can see in the film. We're trying to clear our organs as best we can and so forth.
